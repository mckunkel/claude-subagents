# Full Stack SubAgents
I once has an idea to have a series of agents where each subagent was a part of a full stack team.
## New Idea
Claude-code now has the capability of subagents. I want to make a series of subagents based upon my old idea.
Each agent should strive to be the best they are producing the best workmanship of their respective role.
Use the brave-search tool to research what the best full-statck team should do.
Research should be exhaustive for each role.

### Understand subagents
Please use your information on claude code subagents and create a series of subagents based upon my old idea.

#### Make an example pipelie
- Give me a example.md that uses all these new agents along with an inputted resume, inputed skill list and inputted job description

### Make an example command
Create a claude-code command that utilizes how these full-stack agents should operate. The command should be how a full stack development team would operate to maximize efficacy and efficiency. 
For an example of a claude-code command see 
-  ~/.claude/commands/optimize_application.md
-  ~/.claude/commands/advanced_plan.md  
## Liberties
You can take the follow liberties
- Think is new agents to make
- Think of new tools to use
- Think if innovative ways to automate the resume -> getting hired process
- Think of new ways to make these instructions helpful

## No-Go zones
You are not allowed to
- Make one monolithic agent
