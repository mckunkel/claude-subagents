# Integration Test: Product → Architecture → Frontend Pipeline

## Test Scenario
Test the complete workflow from business requirements through technical architecture to frontend implementation for a task management application.

## Pipeline Flow Test
1. **Product Manager**: Analyze requirements and create user stories
2. **Technical Architect**: Review PM output and design technical architecture  
3. **Frontend Developer**: Implement UI components based on architecture

## Test Input
```
Project Brief: "Build a collaborative task management platform for remote development teams. 
Key features: real-time collaboration, Git integration, progress tracking, team communication.
Target: 50-200 users initially. Budget: $40,000. Timeline: 10 weeks."
```

## Expected Pipeline Output
1. **Product Manager Output**: Detailed user stories, personas, feature prioritization
2. **Technical Architect Output**: System architecture, technology stack, technical specifications
3. **Frontend Developer Output**: React components, routing structure, state management implementation

## Success Criteria
- Each agent builds upon the previous agent's output
- Technical decisions align with business requirements
- Frontend implementation matches architectural specifications
- No information loss or misalignment between handoffs
- Complete traceability from business requirements to code implementation
