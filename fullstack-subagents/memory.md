## Current Implementation Status

### Research Findings
1. **Claude Code Subagents Structure**
   - Use `.claude/agents/` for project-level agents
   - YAML frontmatter with name, description, tools
   - Focused, single-purpose design
   - System prompts for role specialization

2. **Full-Stack Team Roles Identified**
   - Frontend Developer (UI/UX focus)
   - Backend Developer (API/Database focus)
   - DevOps Engineer (Infrastructure/Deployment)
   - Product Manager (Requirements/Strategy)
   - QA Engineer (Testing/Quality)
   - Technical Architect (System Design)
   - Site Reliability Engineer (Monitoring/Performance)

3. **Key MCP Tools Researched** (26 tools total)
   - **Tier 1 Essential (12 tools)**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, Git, Browser Automation, Lighthouse, API Testing, Jest, Cypress, GitHub, File System
   - **Tier 2 Important (10 tools)**: Figma, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Redis, A11y Audit, Selenium, SonarQube, Prometheus, Notion
   - **Tier 3 Useful (4 tools)**: SQLite, Grafana, PagerDuty, Slack
   - **Custom Implementation Needed**: 8 tools require community development

## Outstanding Issues and Known Limitations
- Individual subagent implementations need to be created (22 steps in plan)
- MCP tools need to be installed and configured for testing
- Agent communication protocols need to be tested with real data
- Performance optimization may be needed after initial implementation

## Decisions Made and Rationales
1. **Follow Hiring-Subagents Pattern**: Use proven structure from existing implementation
2. **Incremental Development**: Build agents individually, then integrate
3. **Tool Specialization**: Each agent has specific MCP tools for their domain
4. **Example-Driven Development**: Create comprehensive example.md to guide implementation

## Prioritized To-Do List
1. **HIGH**: Begin Step 1 of implementation plan - Research and document all MCP tools
2. **HIGH**: Create first subagent (Product Manager) following plan
3. **HIGH**: Establish testing framework for agent integration
4. **MEDIUM**: Install and configure essential MCP tools
5. **MEDIUM**: Create sample project for testing workflows
6. **LOW**: Performance optimization after core functionality

## Roadblocks Encountered
- None yet - in initial planning phase

## Useful Remarks for Future Sessions
- The existing hiring-subagents provides excellent blueprint for structure
- Focus on creating specialized, single-purpose agents rather than monolithic solution
- Each agent should have clear input/output contracts for seamless integration
- Plan should include comprehensive testing at each integration point
- Consider performance implications of agent communication chains
