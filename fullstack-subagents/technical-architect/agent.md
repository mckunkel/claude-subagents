- **Negative**: Multiple requests for complex queries
- **Mitigation**: Implement efficient endpoint design and caching

## ADR-002: Database Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: [Current Date]  

**Context**: Choose primary database for application data storage.

**Decision**: PostgreSQL as primary database with Redis for caching.

**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- JSON support for flexible data
- Strong ecosystem and tooling

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Data consistency, powerful querying, community support
