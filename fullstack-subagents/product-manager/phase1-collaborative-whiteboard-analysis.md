### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- Technical architecture document with detailed WebSocket design
- Database schema for canvas data and user sessions
- API specification for frontend-backend communication
- Scalability and performance optimization plan
- Security and authentication strategy

### Questions for Technical Architect
1. What WebSocket framework/technology would best support our latency requirements?
2. How should we handle data persistence for large canvas sessions?
3. What's the optimal conflict resolution strategy for real-time collaborative editing?
4. How can we ensure the architecture scales efficiently from MVP to enterprise?
