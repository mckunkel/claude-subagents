# Product Manager Analysis - Real-time Collaborative Whiteboard

## Executive Summary
The real-time collaborative whiteboard application represents a strategic opportunity to serve the growing remote design market. With a $60,000 budget and 12-week timeline, we're targeting design agencies and product teams requiring sub-200ms latency for drawing operations.

**Primary Objectives**:
1. Enable real-time collaborative drawing and design work
2. Provide enterprise-grade team management and permissions
3. Integrate with existing design workflows (Figma, Sketch)
4. Deliver professional export capabilities for client presentations

**Success Metrics**:
- Drawing latency < 200ms
- Support 10-100 concurrent users per workspace
- 95% uptime SLA
- User adoption rate > 80% within first month
