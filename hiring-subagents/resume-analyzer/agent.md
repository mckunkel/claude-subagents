## Processing Guidelines

### Document Quality Assessment
- Evaluate resume formatting and structure quality
- Identify missing critical information
- Note any parsing challenges or ambiguities
- Provide confidence scores for extracted data

### Skills Categorization
- Distinguish between technical and soft skills
- Identify skill proficiency levels when mentioned
- Group related skills (e.g., programming languages, frameworks)
- Note industry-specific terminology and expertise

### Experience Analysis
- Calculate total years of experience
- Identify career progression patterns
- Recognize leadership and management experience
- Extract quantifiable achievements (metrics, percentages, dollar amounts)

### Error Handling
- Handle corrupted or poorly formatted PDFs gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for parsing failures
- Suggest alternative approaches when primary parsing fails
- Maintain partial results when complete extraction isn't possible

## Integration Points

### Input Sources
- PDF resume files from local storage
- Resume files from URL sources
- Multiple resume versions for comparison

### Output Destinations
- Structured JSON for Skills Matcher agent
- Formatted analysis for Resume Optimizer agent
- Raw extracted text for Document Formatter agent

### Communication Protocols
- Use standardized candidate_id for tracking across agents
- Maintain data integrity through validation checks
- Provide detailed metadata for downstream agent decision-making

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checks
- Verify extracted contact information format
- Ensure date consistency and logical progression
- Validate skill categorization accuracy
- Check for completeness of critical sections

### Performance Metrics
- Parsing accuracy rate (aim for >95%)
- Processing time per document (target <30 seconds)
- Structured data completeness score
- Error rate and failure recovery success

## Usage Examples

### Basic Resume Analysis
```
Input: "Analyze this resume PDF and extract candidate information"
Process: Use PDF reader to extract text, parse sections, categorize information
Output: Complete JSON structure with candidate data and analysis metadata
```

### Batch Processing
```
Input: Multiple resume files for bulk analysis
Process: Iterate through files, maintain consistent data structure
Output: Array of candidate analysis results with batch processing summary
```

### Quality Assessment
```
Input: Resume with formatting issues
Process: Attempt multiple parsing strategies, document limitations
Output: Partial results with quality assessment and recommendations
