# Hiring Agents
I once has an idea to have a series of agents to analyze a resume, analyze a job posting and have several AI agents help be tailor my resume based upon not only my resume, but a skill-set document. 
You can find the code for this idea at 
- /Users/Mike/Documents/GitHub/cv-agents/
With the agents being define in 
- /Users/Mike/Documents/GitHub/cv-agents/src/agents/job_application_crew.py

## New Idea
Claude-code now has the capability of subagents. I want to make a series of subagents based upon my old idea.

### Understand subagents
Please use your information on claude code subagents and create a series of subagents based upon my old idea.

#### Make an example pipelie
- Give me a example.md that uses all these new agents along with an inputted resume, inputed skill list and inputted job description

## Liberties
You can take the follow liberties
- Think is new agents to make
- Think of new tools to use
- Think if innovative ways to automate the resume -> getting hired process
- Think of new ways to make these instructions helpful

## No-Go zones
You are not allowed to
- Make one monolithic agent
